## Description

    For this assignment, I created an employee directory with React.  It required me to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events

## Installation

    You can clone the repository and then do npm i && npm start.

## Usgae

    As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.  An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees.  It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
